To OfferUp,

I am declining both the agreement to arbitrate and the class-action waiver in the new OfferUp Terms of Service.

Specifically, I am referring to the new OfferUp terms of service posted at https://discord.com/terms effective 2024 April 8. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my disagreement to the class-action waivers, per section 21 "Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration".

**Consider this an unequivocal statement that I wish to opt out of the arbitration clause and the class-action waiver in the Discord Terms of Service.**
