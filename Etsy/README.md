# Etsy arbitration summary

Etsy requires your name, the email address for your account, your username, and your shop name (if applicable). Etsy only takes arbitration opt-out notices to [arbitrationoptout@etsy.com](mailto:arbitrationoptout@etsy.com), and they have a 30 day opt-out window.

Etsy's Terms have unique language whch says "if we update the Terms after you validly opt out, we will continue to respect your opt-out, but such updates do not provide a new opportunity to opt out of arbitration." That is to say, if you miss your chance to opt out, Etsy will not consider future opt-out requests even when they publish new Terms of Service agreements.

Etsy's Terms also state that any claims not settled in arbitration will be settled in New York, except for claims in small-claims court.
