To Etsy,

I am declining both the agreement to arbitrate and the class-action waiver in the new Etsy Terms of Service.


Specifically, I am referring to the new Etsy terms of service posted at https://www.etsy.com/legal/terms-of-use on 2023 June 15th, effective 2023 July 24. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my disagreement to the class-action waivers, per Section 11 "Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver".


**Consider this an unequivocal statement that I wish to opt out of the arbitration clause and the class-action waiver in the Etsy Terms of Service.** My account information is as follows:

 - Name:

 - Email address:

 - Username:

 - Shop name:


Please update your records accordingly.

Best regards,
