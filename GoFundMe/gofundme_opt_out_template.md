Arbitration Opt-Out Notice

I am declining both the agreement to arbitrate and the class-action waiver in the new GoFundMe Terms of Service.

Specifically, I am referring to the new GoFundMe terms of service posted at https://www.gofundme.com/c/gofundme-terms-of-service effective 2024 September 1. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my disagreement to the class-action waivers, per section "18.1 (h) Dispute Resolution & Arbitration: Opt Out".

**Consider this an unequivocal statement that I wish to opt out of the arbitration clause and the class-action waiver in the GoFundMe Terms of Service.**
