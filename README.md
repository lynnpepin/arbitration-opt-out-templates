Arbitration Opt-Out Templates
===

**Reclaim your basic legal rights by opting out of arbitration!**

This repository provides templates to opt out of arbitration clauses (and related) in the United States. [Arbitration clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_in_the_United_States#Arbitration_clauses) ask consumers to give up their right to sue a corporation in court, and often prohibit them from suing in a class-basis, or even pursuing arbitration with a lawyer as representation.

**Important:** This repository is not produced by lawyers, does not constitute legal advice, and we are not your representatives.

## Wall of shame

Some services have arbitration clauses, class-action waivers, and jury-trial waivers with no opt-out clause. These are extreme, these are awful, and **you should never do business with these services.** There's a reason they don't even offer a provision to opt out.

## Wall of fame

Some services don't come with an arbitration clause at all. This is a good thing.

# Contribution

There are many ways you can contribute to this project!

## Raising an issue for a missing template

Want to opt out of a service that isn't listed here? Make an issue for it to bring it to our attention!

## Raise an issue if something is confusing!

If a template is unclear or you don't know what to do, please raise an issue and let us know. The goal is to make this as accessible as possible.

## Update an opt-out template

Terms change constantly. Updating a template or raising an issue when it's out of date is very helpful.

## Contribute a new opt-out template!

There are so many services, and this repository will never be complete. Creating a new template is immensely useful.

Each service is listed in a folder. At minimum, please include:

- A **README.md** which includes:
  - A link to the service Terms of Service
  - A last-update date
  - Instructions on how to opt-out
- The opt-out template in at least the following formats:
  - Markdown (`.md`)
  - For opt-outs which require printing:
    - PDF
    - .docx

In the per-service README, you are welcome to include any relevant articles or legal cases involving the service and arbitration. You are also welcome to provide a summary of the arbitration clause, related clauses, and the opt-out provisions.
