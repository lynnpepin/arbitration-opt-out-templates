Arbitration Opt-Out Templates
===

**Reclaim your basic legal rights by opting out of arbitration!**

This repository provides templates to opt out of arbitration clauses (and related) in the United States. [Arbitration clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_in_the_United_States#Arbitration_clauses) ask consumers to give up their right to sue a corporation in court, and often prohibit them from suing in a class-basis, or even pursuing arbitration with a lawyer as representation.

**Important:** This repository is not produced by lawyers, does not constitute legal advice, and we are not your representatives.
