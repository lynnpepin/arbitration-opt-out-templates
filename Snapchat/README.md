# Related cases

Snapchat's arbitration clause has been enforced in the past. Most recently, in 2022, an Illinois Seventh Circuit judge ruled in Snapchat's favor to [enforce the arbitration clause the plaintiff entered at only 11 years old](https://madisonrecord.com/stories/622501604-arbitration-not-class-action-is-route-to-settling-youth-s-snapchat-privacy-dispute-seventh-circuit-rules).

Despite the fact that the child was only 11 years old, the court ruled in favor of Snapchat. Snapchat argued "the arbitration provision wasnâ€™t difficult to find, read, or understand", and Snapchat argued that the child was capable of giving consent.

In a separate 2017 case, Snapchat was able to [shut-down a whistleblower](https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/snapchat-judge-pompliano-arbitration-1202750638/) when a federal judge enforced the arbitration clause from a 2015 employment contract.

As of this writing, [Meta, Roblox, Discord, and Snapchat have an active case alleging the financial and sexual exploitation of an eleven year old, facilitated by the Discord platform.](https://socialmediavictims.org/press-releases/smvlc-files-first-lawsuit-against-roblox-discord/). The lawsuit is able to proceed because [the plaintiffs are her parents, who do not use Snapchat or Discord, and are not bound by their clauses](https://socialmediavictims.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/C.U.-S.U.-Complaint-10_4_22-Filed.pdf).
