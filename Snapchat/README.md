# Related cases

SnapChat's arbitration clause has been enforced in the past. Most recently, in 2022, an Illinois Seventh Circuit judge ruled in Snapchat's favor to [enforce the arbitration clause the plaintiff entered at only 11 years old](https://madisonrecord.com/stories/622501604-arbitration-not-class-action-is-route-to-settling-youth-s-snapchat-privacy-dispute-seventh-circuit-rules).

Snapchat succesfully argued "the arbitration provision wasnâ€™t difficult to find, read, or understand" and that the 11 year old child was indeed able to consnet.

In 2017, Snapchat was able to [shut-down a whistleblower](https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/snapchat-judge-pompliano-arbitration-1202750638/) when a federal judge enforced the arbitration clause from a 2015 employment contract.
