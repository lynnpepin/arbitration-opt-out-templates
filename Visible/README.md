To Visible,

I am declining both the agreement to arbitrate and the class-action waiver in the new Visible Terms of Service.

Specifically, I am referring to the new Visible terms of service posted at https://www.visible.com/legal/terms-and-conditions effective 2024 Feb 6. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my disagreement to the class-action waivers, per section "Dispute Resolution".

**Consider this an unequivocal statement that I wish to opt out of the arbitration clause and the class-action waiver in the Visible Terms of Service.**
