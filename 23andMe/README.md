Despite the terms pointing users to [arbitrationoptout@23andme.com](mailto:arbitrationoptout@23andme.com), the *email* they sent pointed to [legal@23andme.com](mailto:legal@23andme.com). For best measure, we recommend sending the optout to both addresses.

The company has understated the extent of the breach with each communication. 23andMe [initially and incorrectly stated that the breach impacted only 0.1% of the customers](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/23andme-confirms-hackers-stole-ancestry-data-on-6-9-million-users/), incorrectly claiming the breach was [simply a credential stuffing attach](https://www.engadget.com/23andme-user-data-breached-in-credential-stuffing-attack-231757254.html), when in reality [the breach impacts at least 50% of their userbase and is unlikely to be a credential stuffing attack.](https://www.engadget.com/23andme-hack-now-estimated-to-affect-over-half-of-customers-165314743.html)

Until this point, 23andMe did not have a mandatory arbitration clause. [They only waived your right to a trial after the fact.](https://www.engadget.com/23andme-frantically-changed-its-terms-of-service-to-prevent-hacked-customers-from-suing-152434306.html)
