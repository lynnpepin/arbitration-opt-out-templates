Arbitration Opt-Out

I am declining both the agreement to arbitrate and the class-action waiver in the new Vimeo Terms of Service.

Specifically, I am referring to the new Vimeo terms of service posted at https://vimeo.com/terms#30_day_right_to_opt_out effective 2024 July 9. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my disagreement to the class-action waivers, per section per section "11.7 30-Day Right to Opt Out".

**Consider this an unequivocal statement that I wish to opt out of the arbitration clause and the class-action waiver in the Vimeo Terms of Service.**
