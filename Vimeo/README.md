Arbitration Opt-Out

I am declining both the agreement to arbitrate and the class-action waiver in the new Vimeo Terms of Service.

Specifically, I am referring to the new Vimeo terms of service posted at https://vimeo.com/terms#30_day_right_to_opt_out effective 2024 July 9. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my disagreement to the class-action waivers, per section per section "11.7 30-Day Right to Opt Out".

**Consider this an unequivocal statement that I wish to opt out of the arbitration clause and the class-action waiver in the Vimeo Terms of Service.**

## Vimeo arbitration clause

> **11.7 30-Day Right to Opt Out**
>
> You have the right to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out of individual binding arbitration to arbitration-opt-out@vimeo.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to the Arbitration Agreement (for new users) or within 30 days after you become subject to any changes to the Arbitration Agreement (for existing users). If you opt out of a change to the Arbitration Agreement (for an existing user), you will continue to be bound by any prior Arbitration Agreements to which you did not opt out. To validly opt out, your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to register your Vimeo account (or if no email address is associated with your Vimeo account, any valid email address where you can be contacted), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out, Vimeo will also not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement, and all other parts of these Terms of Service will continue to apply to you. Opting out of the Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
