# Movie Anywhere arbitration summary

Movie Anywhere's Terms of Service include a class-action waiver and an arbitration clause. MoviesAnywhere only accepts opt-out by letter, and users must explicitly opt out to both the class-action waiver and the arbitration clause.

Users can choose to opt out of only the class-action waiver, only the arbitration clause, or both.

Movie Anywhere requires opt-out within 30 days of notice, and considers any lapse in opt-out to bind someone to the arbitration clause. This means users must opt out of Movie Anywhere's arbitration clause every time the Terms update.
