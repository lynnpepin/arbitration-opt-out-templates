# Discord arbitration summary

Discord's Terms of Service include a class-action waiver and an arbitration clause. To opt-out, users can send an email to [arbitration-opt-out@discord.com](mailto:arbitration-opt-out@discord.com), but they must explicitly opt out to both the class-action waiver and the arbitration clause.

Discord does not explicitly list what data must be provided when opting out.

Discord requires opt-out within 30 days of notice, and considers any lapse in opt-out to bind someone to the arbitration clause. This means users must opt out of Discord's arbitration clause every time the Terms update.

As of this writing, [Meta, Roblox, Discord, and Snapchat have an active case alleging the financial and sexual exploitation of an eleven year old, facilitated by the Discord platform.](https://socialmediavictims.org/press-releases/smvlc-files-first-lawsuit-against-roblox-discord/). The lawsuit is able to proceed because [the plaintiffs are her parents, who do not use Snapchat or Discord, and are not bound by their clauses](https://socialmediavictims.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/C.U.-S.U.-Complaint-10_4_22-Filed.pdf). This child is very lucky her parents were not bound by Discord's arbitration clause.

Because arbitration courts are not courts of law, there is very little insight into what Discord's arbitration proceedings look like.
