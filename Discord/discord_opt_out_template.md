To Discord,

I am declining both the agreement to arbitrate and the class-action waiver in the new Discord Terms of Service.

Specifically, I am referring to the new Discord terms of service posted at https://discord.com/terms on 2023 February 24, effective 2023 March 27. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my disagreement to the class-action waivers, per section 14 "Settling disputes between you and Discord".

**Consider this an unequivocal statement that I wish to opt out of the arbitration clause and the class-action waiver in the Discord Terms of Service.** My account information is as follows:
