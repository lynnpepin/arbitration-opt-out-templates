To Discord,

I am declining the agreement to arbitrate and I am declining the class-action waiver in the new Discord Terms of Service.

I am sending this from my email ✨email here✨, associated with my account ✨username here✨.

Specifically, I am referring to the new Discord terms of service posted at https://discord.com/terms on 2023 February 24, effective 2023 March 27. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my disagreement to the class-action waivers, per section 14 "Settling disputes between you and Discord"

Best regards,

✨signature here too✨.
