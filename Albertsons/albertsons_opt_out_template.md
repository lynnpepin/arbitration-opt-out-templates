Arbitration Opt-Out

I am declining both the agreement to arbitrate and the class-action waiver in the new Albertsons Terms of Service.

Specifically, I am referring to the new Albertsons terms of service posted at https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/policies-and-disclosures/terms-of-use/ effective 2024 May 7. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my disagreement to the class-action waivers, per section 21 "Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration".

**Consider this an unequivocal statement that I wish to opt out of the arbitration clause and the class-action waiver in the Albertsons Terms of Service.**
